# Flowcharts

This folder contains system process flowcharts for the Airbnb Clone project.

## Current Flowchart
- `booking-flowchart.png` â†’ Shows the step-by-step process of property booking:
  1. User selects a property.
  2. Enters booking dates.
  3. System checks availability.
  4. If available, booking is confirmed and payment is processed.
  5. System updates the database and sends confirmation notifications.

## Purpose
Flowcharts help visualize backend processes clearly so developers and stakeholders can understand the sequence of operations.
